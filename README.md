# Final Project - ParkHere
In our project, we will present a solution to the problem of finding parking by combining two algorithms:

- A ML algorithm that identifies a free parking lot by image - With YOLO V5
- An algorithm that ranks each parking lot located based on the data set and environmental parameters.

Image-based parking spotting systems already exist in the market but do not emphasize the likelihood that the parking lot will remain free until reaching the destination.

By combining these two algorithms, we will be able to locate the location of a free parking lot for the user and check the likelihood that the parking lot will remain free and available for parking until he arrives there.

The output of the project will be a destination address where the relevant parking was found after the system's calculation.
