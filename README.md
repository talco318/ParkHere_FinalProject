# ParkHere Bot
ParkHere is a Telegram bot that helps drivers efficiently find parking using computer vision.

## Description:
Tired of circling endlessly searching for parking? ParkHere leverages street cameras and AI to identify available spots and notify you via Telegram. It's your personal parking assistant!
In our project, we will present a solution to the problem of finding parking by combining two algorithms:

- A ML algorithm that identifies a free parking lot by image - With YOLO V5
- An algorithm that ranks each parking lot located based on the data set and environmental parameters.

## Features:
YOLOv5 model detects vacant parking spots from CCTV
Built and deployed Telegram bot to share parking notifications
Users receive alerts when spots open up in monitored areas
Integrates computer vision, Telegram API, and Google Maps
Saves time wasted hunting for parking

## How to Use: 
Message @ParkHereBot on Telegram
Share your location to receive alerts for your area
Get notifications when the bot detects an open spot near you!
Tap the spot on the map to navigate there with Google Maps
Why This Project?
ParkHere combines my interests in computer vision and bots to solve the daily frustration of finding parking. With this bot, drivers can spend less time searching and reduce unnecessary circling.
